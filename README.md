# ANTLR 4 Gradle template

This project defines a simple template to use ANTLR 4 with Java in a modern Gradle project and IntelliJ IDEA.

It is a fork of Gabriele Tomassetti's [ANTLR mega tutorial](https://tomassetti.me/antlr-mega-tutorial/) [companion repository](https://github.com/gabriele-tomassetti/antlr-mega-tutorial),
integrated with [my own modifications](https://github.com/NiccoMlt/antlr-java) added when I was learning ANTLR following that tutorial.
